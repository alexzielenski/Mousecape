幻标（Mousecape）
===

‎一个免费的指针管理器（适用于MacOS 10.8+）。使用私有、非侵入式 CoreGraphics API 构建。‎

![](https://github.com/alexzielenski/Mousecape/raw/master/screenshot.png)

## 工作原理

Mousecape works by calling the API calls that Apple uses to initialize the system cursors in the system and it registers a daemon that will automatically apply the cursor on login and when cursors get unregistered.

It is unintrusive and works in the background. You just need to open the app, click **Mousecape --> Install Helper Tool**, apply your cursor and you're done!

## Where do I get cursors?

A pack of cursors in Mousecape is called a cape, each cape contains a multiple scales of representations of many cursors. For example, the Arrow cursor can have 1x, 2x, 5x, and 10x representations while the Wait cursor can have 1x, and 2x. 

There is an example cape file included in this Git Repo located [here for download](https://github.com/alexzielenski/Mousecape/blob/master/Mousecape/com.maxrudberg.svanslosbluehazard.cape). It is a remake of [Max Rudberg's](http://maxrudberg.com/) loved Svanslös cursors generously crafted by Max for us to use. Simply double click the cape file with Mousecape on your system and it will be imported into your library.

## How can I create my own cape?

You can create a new cape document in the Mousecape app by hitting &#8984;N (Command-N) and editing it with &#8984;E. Click the "+" button to add cursors to customize and symply drag your images into the fields provided.

## How do animated cursors work?

When you want to animate a cursor, change the value in the frames field in the edit window and make sure frame duration is how you want it. Next, create an image that has all of your cursor frames stacked on top of each other vertically. Mousecape will traverse down the image for each frame, using a box the same size as whatever you put in the size field.

## How can I say thanks?
