/**
 * Used to list methods with concrete implementations within a \@protocol
 * definition.
 *
 * Semantically, this is equivalent to using \@optional, but is recommended for
 * documentation reasons. Although concrete protocol methods are optional in the
 * sense that conforming objects don't need to implement them, they are,
 * however, always guaranteed to be present.

/**
 * Defines a "concrete protocol," which can provide default implementations of
 * methods within protocol \a NAME. A \@protocol block should exist in a header
 * file, and a corresponding \@concreteprotocol block in an implementation file.
 * Any object that declares itself to conform to protocol \a NAME will receive
 * its method implementations \e only if no method by the same name already
 * exists.
 *
 * @code

// MyProtocol.h
@protocol MyProtocol
@required
- (void)someRequiredMethod;

@optional
- (void)someOptionalMethod;

@concrete
- (BOOL)isConcrete;

@end

// MyProtocol.m

// required to have their own implementation

 *
 * If a concrete protocol \c X conforms to another concrete protocol \c Y, any
 * concrete implementations in \c X will be prioritized over those in \c Y. In
 * other words, if both protocols provide a default implementation for a method,
 * the one from \c X (the most descendant) is the one that will be loaded into
 * any class that conforms to \c X. Classes that conform to \c Y will naturally
 * only use the implementations from \c Y.
 *
 * To perform tasks when a concrete protocol is loaded, use the \c +initialize
 * method. This method in a concrete protocol is treated similarly to \c +load
 * in categories â€“ it will be executed at most once per concrete protocol, and
 * is not added to any classes which receive the concrete protocol's methods.
 * The protocol's methods will have been added to all conforming classes at the
 * time that \c +initialize is invoked. If no class conforms to the concrete
 * protocol, \c +initialize may never be called.
 *
 * @note You cannot define instance variables in a concrete protocol.
 *
 * @warning You should not invoke methods against \c super in the implementation
 * of a concrete protocol, as the superclass may not be the type you expect (and
 * may not even inherit from \c NSObject).
